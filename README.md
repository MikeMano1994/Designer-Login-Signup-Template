## 4.   Running the Project
Clone the repository and open the "Mockup01.sln" to open the project in Visual Studio. Let it download all the packages required by project which is not a lot, just AppCompat libraries.

If for some reason Project failed to "build" , then Open Nuget Package Manager in Visual Studio and Install all the visible packages.
Then, "Clean" the project and then try to "Build".

PS: Try to keep path of Project as small as possible, because Xamarin File Path size limitations for "Building" Project.
